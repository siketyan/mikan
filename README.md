Yet another implementation of MikanOS for aarch64 CPUs, written in Rust.

MikanOS ([uchan-nos/mikanos](https://github.com/uchan-nos/mikanos)) was originally created by @uchan-nos,
who is author of the book [„Çº„É≠„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆ OS Ëá™‰ΩúÂÖ•ÈñÄ](https://zero.osdev.jp/) by Mynavi Publishing Corporation.
I tried to port this OS to aarch64 CPUs, written in Rust, built on macOS.
For details of this OS and C++ implementation, please refer the original repository.

Note that this repository aims to implement all features of MikanOS, but their design and implementation is customised
and optimised for writing in Rust.

## Features
- Supports aarch64 (ARM64) CPUs
- Written in Rust (no_std)
- Built on macOS

## Prerequisites
- Rust Toolchain (1.65-nightly+)
- QEMU
- dosfstools (macOS only)

## Building
Builds a disk image and boots them on QEMU by calling only one command: 

```shell
make boot
```
